There is space for a front loader washing machine only beneath the benchtops, but nowhere to plug it in so you have to run it over the top of the bench. Very steep driveway and it is challenging to get a car in the garage but council is cracking down on parking at the top of the driveway. There is no street parking as its all no stopping signs on this side of the road. There have been consistent mouse problems (evident even in the imprint of one in the concrete before it even dried in the garage) and you can't use the laundry sink without the washer plugged in because it overflows into the cupboard. Water pressure is awful and the water is barely more than lukewarm. Real estate treat you like a product they are selling to the owners and don't care about you as a person.

This review is for the landlord and his one-of-ten investment properties specifically. He was rude to us, to trades fixing his property, and to his property managers on several occasions. He would carry out repairs himself, or if they required \"licensed\" repairs, always seemed to have a \"licensed\" buddy who he'd come around with and supervise. He would turn up unannounced or when we had declined him access (because he'd give 0-2 hours notice on average that he wanted to come around). We breached him on quiet enjoyment grounds for this and it did continue to happen. The house, while quite a nice house of itself, was terribly maintained. Mice and rats came in through unsealed plumbing in the kitchen. The gutters were filthy when we moved in (a previous resident had been throwing toilet rolls out the upstairs ensuite window for some reason, these were among many leaves, weeds and dirt in the gutters) and were literally never cleaned even though we flagged this at every inspection. A leak in one of the gutters turned out to have been an internal pipe that had been leaking into a wall upstairs then onto a roof for an extended time. That pipe did eventually burst catastrophically, caving in the master bedroom ceiling and leaving that room uninhabitable for nearly 3 months while we waited for repairs. We were offered no compensation nor any rent relief for this despite requesting it. Instead we were offered/told that our rent would increase at the next lease cycle. We vacated after all this, despite the rent crisis and our own circumstances meaning this was quite difficult physically to achieve, but we literally preferred to be homeless and couch surf rather than pay this landlord a single cent more than we already had.

On three seperate occasions a plumber was sent out and each time, the plumber (different plumbers each time) said that the hot water service was unfixable and needed replacing. The landlord ignored this advice and told them to do a Band-Aid fix. This culminated in me coming home from work one day to discover that the the hot water service had ruptured and there was water gushing out which filled the room the unit was in and also leaked through the floor into the room below.

It was 11pm at night, so we called an emergency plumber. The plumber closed off the pipe and said that the copper piping was old and had burst. When we emailed the landlord she became very angry and accused us of malicious damage.

After being long term tenants we were evicted during the Moratorium on evictions during the pandemic in 2021. The landlord needed to temporarily move back in to the property while their other property was being renovated. We could have taken them to VCAT over this but we opted to go down the path of least resistance and move out. During the tenancy repairs were frequently ignored, e.g. the dishwasher was broken for 6 months and when I finally escalated it to a formal complaint with the agency, the landlord tried to guilt trip me over it. We also couldn't lock our front or back door and the landlord claimed it was because the 'house shifted' and it would shift back when the weather changed. But we literally couldn't lock the property for months. The property had been a rental for 9 years and in the end they wanted to keep our bond over things that were wear and tear - they also claimed we must have changed the locks because their keys didn't work and so they wanted us to pay for that too - we had to remind them that they told us the 'house shifted' in some seasons and we'd certainly never changed them, but they insisted we pay for replacement locks lol. We countered by saying we wanted a portion of rent returned to us from the 6 months we'd not had a functional dishwasher and that we were happy to go VCAT. With the threat of VCAT the landlord eventually backed down and our bond was returned but it was such a stressful, protracted process to get our bond back for a property we'd really cared for and were unceremoniously evicted from. The agency always defaulted to the landlord's position - if they'd been more firm with the landlord about their legal responsibilities to tenants, a lot of the tedious back and forth could have been avoided.

Issues with the build included:\n- Window condensation amassing\n- Drains randomly clogging\n- Shower door seal not attached properly and peeling off\n- When you would open doors they'd open into other walls or doors\n- Front door would deadlock and couldn't be unlocked. We first moved in none of the doors inside would lock properly unless you manually deadlocked them from the inside. Everyone in the building complained and it was never resolved.\n- The common space front door to the building would constantly have to be left open due to deadlocking incorrectly. \n- it was also zoned differently with the council than with the real estate agency. so god forbid you would get any mail delivered. it had two addresses.\n\nThe other issues came about from an absolutely buckwild weirdo of a landlord/property investor and the actions of the real estate.\n- In 2016 the building was broken into. Everyone's storage cages were slashed open and partially destroyed with everyone losing stuff. The real estate refused to engage with police officers (despite officers asking and needing this for multiple reasons). Our neighbor didn't have her slashed storage cage fixed for 4 months after the break-in and had to used MDF board and a 'decoy' suitcase to block the damaged area. I randomly got a text from the property manager 12 months after the break-in asking for the cops details when she finally decided to respond to their messages.\n- After living at the property for 2 years, the dishwasher broke and was flooding. After sending out a plumber (who didn't flush a shit the took in our toilet) this issue still persisted. It was deduced that the issue was a faulty pipe install that had given up the ghost after a period of time. After 4 months of back and forth on getting it fixed, the Landlord visited with the new property manager and gave me a packet of dishwashing tablets because 'modern women like yourself don't know how to do the dishes properly and thats why it's broken'. I explained that i was related to plumbers and that the issue had been deduced to be a faulty pipe. The landlord left  and sent out another plumber when we vacated the property to have it fixed and re-listed.\n- The property investor/owner of most the apartments (including ours) had a son with a giant luxury jeep who was working nearby. he would give the son access to our storage units and private garage so he could park his car wherever he wanted. Several times he would park his monster of a jeep in peoples parking spots, which were operated by a elevator system which ended up damaging the carpark system and damaging car spaces. Several times the son also parked his car in front of everyone's cars pots and would leave for hours. We would all not have access to our cars during this time because of this.\n- That same son would also carry out random maintenance on the building or just hang out in the garage from time to time. One day he built a private shed over the guest and disabled cars pots in the building and didn't tell the real estate agent who found out during an inspection. We were all told to 'just ignore him, he's built a little house'\n- When we vacated the property, we were at first refused our bond returned because 'the landlord wants the apartment in perfect condition as it was a brand new apartment'. We had been told we were ideal tenants during our stay and the place was cleaned from head to toe. We later found out, after many phone calls and contacting the renters union, that he wanted the 'streak marks on the mirrored backsplash gone'. these were from windex we had used to clean it. He also didn't want to return our bond because the balcony 'had puddles on it and the sliding glass door had water droplets on it'. It had rained the day we handed the keys back. We did get our bond back when we threatened VCAT. But the real estate agency had made a series of intimidating phone calls during that week and wanted me to skip work to talk to them, they kept insisting that it was a legal requirement to 'hire their cleaners' when that wasn't true. None of these people were our property manager.\n\nI have never been happier to be out of an apartment.\n\nSince vacating and being out for several years, we found out from small business owners in Murrumbeena that one night someone had firebombed the apartment building during the covid lockdowns.

    "review": "House is in terrible condition; weatherboards, windows/doors, trimmings, ceiling and carpet are all old, filthy and falling apart. \n\nFly wire is broken or missing from almost all windows, glass of the windows is stained by a bad tinting job (most likely diy). Very old, damaged and clunky venetian blinds on most windows that struggle to go up and down. The entire blind in one bedroom fell off onto my head when I tried to lower it the day before I moved out.\n\nOn move in day there was a broken window that was patched with cardboard and duct tape, the handle fell off the bathroom door, and there was no extractor fan in the empty kitchen vent. We then randomly received an extractor fan on our doorstep with no communication or instructions on how to install it...\n\nTiny, dated bathroom with poor ventilation, extensive water damage in bathroom cupboards, super weird shower/tub combo and the mirror was supposedly hung for someone who is 7 feet tall. Hard to check your reflection when you can only see the top of your head.\n\nTerrible air circulation due to the layout of the house, it is humid and stuffy constantly and the lack of appropriate window coverings means it gets very hot in summer. There are also barely any power outlets, especially in the kitchen where they are most needed. \n\nThe \"bungalow\" in the back yard looks like it could fall over with a slight breeze and is also filthy and unfinished inside and out, with an exposed foundation and no steps up to the door. It also has mega-creepy peeling wallpaper and general \"murder cabin\" vibes. The yard itself is unmanageable and overrun with weeds and includes such amenities as a dilapidated outdoor kitchen, some dead grapevines, a broken concrete bench right across the middle of the garden path and a rusty clothesline full of ancient pegs that crumble if you try to remove them.\n\nThe oven is ancient and by the end of our lease was completely non-functional. When we were asked to renew our lease we requested that the oven be fixed and the Landlord retracted the lease offer and kept us on a month-to-month lease instead. He sent a plumber to fix the oven and the plumber refused to service it, saying it was so old and unsafe it simply had to be replaced. The landlord then claimed he couldn't afford to replace the oven and instead decided to purchase a benchtop convection oven with no hot plates. It didn't fit on the tiny amount of counter space the kitchen offered, and besides, there was no outlet to plug it into, so we were forced to do our cooking in the second living area.\n\nThe landlord and agent were both terrible at communication and responding to maintenance requests, and the cherry on top of it all was that the Landlord decided to evict us in the middle of the Covid 19 Pandemic, which was made much easier by the fact that he had forced us onto a month-to-month lease earlier. We got to to the point of BEGGING for more time as we were unable to attend any inspections for new properties during the lockdown, but unsurprisingly it fell on deaf ears.\n\nLiterally the only upside to the property is the quirky retro 2nd living area which has wood panelling, an orange shag carpeted bar and cool saloon doors (which broke too anyway)\nAlso the next door neighbour is very nosy and annoying and will knock on your door all the time for the most random things.

Both issues were brought up with the landlord, the first only being fixed a year later while the second was never addressed.\nDuring our tenancy, we noticed multiple gaps in the kitchen where rats would get in, resulting in an infestation we had to manage on our own for a period of ~3 months; evidence in the home showed that this may have been a prior issue to our tenancy, but we were never advised of this. We also noted damp, water damage and mould in the north-end of the property, advised of broken and leaning fences that were not fixed, and rotting foundations in the shed rendering it unable to use beyond basic storage.\nTo their credit, Ray White Eltham were very supportive and understanding, advising us that they would not consider the home up to minimum standards following the end of our lease; we were able to get our full bond returned thanks to our property manager, but had they not done so, we had ample evidence to take the landlord to VCAT for violating peaceful enjoyment of the property as well as failure to make repairs in a reasonable timeframe.\nI'm not sure if the property has since been re-let by another landlord, but based on trips past the property, I can see the home is inhabited again and I doubt these major issues were addressed before re-letting with another landlord.",

When moving a stack of books from the corner of my old room I found the bottom books to be covered in black mould. We told the real estate and they said they would get it sorted for us. It took them 6 months to get someone to even look at it and this man did not seem qualified at all. He had a quick look, sealed some things on the outside of the house and said it was all good. Instead of keeping the moisture out, he sealed the only spot where the water was escaping, causing way more black mould to form. We told the real estate and after 2 and a half months nothing had happened. Our housemate had to move out as he was worried for his health and we couldn't get anyone to move in. After covering his rent for a month we told the real estate we couldn't do this anymore and told them they needed to fix it or we weren't paying full rent. They gave us nothing so we started paying 2/3s rent as only 2/3s of the rooms were inhabitable. The real estate then threatened to take us to tribunal if we were not going to pay full rent so we did some research and found the room had been built without a DA from the council so we were living in there illegally. We informed the real estate of this and told them how upset we were about the whole ideal to which they replied they would sort it out. We had an eviction notice in our mailbox the next day. Ended up going to tribunal, doing a month of research and compiling a whole binder of everything that was wrong with the house. The tribunal lady was horrible to us and said that we couldn't present our side of the story unless we put a claim in against the real estate (the real estate put a claim in against us for tribunal). Being so emotionally exhausted from the whole deal we settled on getting our bond back and calling it quits. Really regretting it now as I think we could have gotten some good money out of it but we needed our bond back at the time to find a new place. ",

And wasn't cute when one bedroom ceiling stated leaking through the light (water and electricity, fab combo!) and when reported as urgent to the agency they said that the landlord responded that there was nothing to worry about. Took him months of DIY fixes that continually didn't work to fix it. By the time it was fixed the leaks had speak to other areas of that same bedroom. Then once finally fixed (wait until I tell you what the fix was) he left the all the very unaesthetic patchwork across the ceiling unpainted. This wasn't a cheap property at the time, and we paid a lot to live in such a nice and big apartment. The leak had been coming from our balcony above, it was a townhouse apartment. After various tries to stop the leak he decided to waterproof over all the floor tiling. So instead of having a lovely balcony that was beautifully styled how it had been to entertain in, our balcony now looked like an empty pool. He waterproofed it with this bright blue rubbery paint that was impossible to clean dirt and dust from so our balcony looked like shit. There were a few other issues throughout the tenancy that I can't recall since it was 5ish years ago but I remember that he was always just as useless at addressing them. And the real estate were terrible at holding him accountable to a higher standard. All other tenants in the block had similar stories of how difficult he's been to deal with.

    "review": "Discovered the communal laundry (of 4 apartments) was all being charged to one apartment, which was ours. We told the realestate straightaway and the promised to 'investigate'. Nothing happened for months even when we called, emailed and texted the real estate daily. After 6 months we were charged an obscenely high power bill as the communal washing and drying machine was used continually through this time. We re-approached the agency asking for some small reimbursement as it seemed outrageous that we should be paying for the complexes laundry facilities. The real estate claimed the landlord denied any problem with the laundry, even though we had an electrician confirm the wiring was directly into our apartment. As we were going no where with the real estate we decided to take the landlord to the Rental Tribunal to be reimbursed for a portion of the power bill and to force her to repair the laundry wiring (as we had been incessantly asking for 6 months). Long story short the landlord sent one of the real estate agents (poor little 18 year old chick) to the tribunal hearing and we somehow lost on a loophole. The landlord argued that she 'didn't know' about the electrical fault before we received the bill so shouldn't be liable to pay. It worked for her. The judge, however, gave us a rental credit and ordered the landlord IMMEDIATELY fix the laundry outlets. Small win i guess? However months passed and the landlord made absolutely no movement towards repairing the laundry outlets. We knew we were STILL PAYING for the communal laundry and threatened to return to tribunal. We then received an email of eviction :-) We had three months to vacate the property. After moving out we got in contact with the new tenants of 2/50 Corunna Rd and told them our situation and we found out that the laundry STILL. HADN'T. BEEN. FIXED. After 1 1/12 of us living there and the new tenants moving in. I'm not sure what they are doing about it but the whole situation was just wild. We felt robbed and abused by the real estate and the evil little landlord. DO NOT MOVE INTO THIS HOUSE OR DEAL WITH THIS REAL ESTATE. Evil. Evil. Evil. ",

    "review": "1. Lies from real estate. Before agreeing to renting the property we were told by Belle Property, Coorparoo, that there was a man who lives in the lower portion of the house (a converted garage). We were told he was a 'friend' of the landlord that is fly-in-fly-out and only resides there one week of the month. We were reluctant to rent the house upon hearing about this man living there, but agreed after being assured from the real estate that he is barely ever home. A few weeks into moving in we discover that it is the landlord that lives under our house and that he has no job and very rarely leaves the house. We contact the real estate to ask why they didn't tell us, and they say they didn't know it was him (I suspect they are lying). \n\n 2. Water Damage. The ceilings appeared to be very water damaged, but we were told they were just stained from a previous leak that had been since repaired. Further into the tenancy we notice the ceilings are leaking, getting more and more water damaged and sagging in a pretty alarming way. We report this and nothing is done. The real estate let me know the landlord is refusing to send people to fix the issue because he will be putting a tarp on the roof. At one point the SES arrived at the house (perhaps due to an after hours maintainer request we put through) and they told us not to enter the lounge room as the ceiling is unsafe.  Eventually the ceiling collapsed in one of the rooms - which did not get fixed for a significant amount of time. All requests for rent reduction were denied. When I contacted the RTA I was informed that there was no legal obligation for the landlord to fix anything, but we had the right to break lease and leave. \n \n3. Threat of eviction. After the ceiling issue, I received a private sms from the landlord stating we would need to move out and he is giving us the official advance notice. The official reason was that he wanted to repair the house. A week later when we ran into each other he verbally told me he wanted us to leave because 'he felt we went behind his back to have repairs done'. I explained that we didn't and he said sorry and said we could stay. \n\n4. Possum and rat infestation. Throughout the tenancy there were rats and possums living in the roof and walls. A year into our tenancy a possum had made a hole in the wall through which we could see the possum sleeping in there during the day. There was a spot on the ceiling that was clearly being used as a toilet for the possum. This spot was above where a person was sleeping. Eventually a possum pissed through the ceiling onto that persons pillow. This person obviously couldn't sleep/be in that room so they moved into the lounge room. All requests for a rent reduction were denied and a month later at the end of lease we were offered a lease renewal with a $70 rent increase. We left at this point. \n\nWhen we were moving out the landlord was painting over the water damage on the ceiling and walls.\n\n",

    "review": "Was mould in the property when we moved in which we mentioned in the condition report. We asked them on multiple occasions to do something about the mould. Firstly they completely ignored that we had complained about the mould and instead listed the issue on TAPI as a roofing issue, and proceeded to get multiple inspectors out to review the roof BUT did nothing the mould and none of the inspectors knew anything about the mould either (in total they had about four inspectors come out about the roof, but nothing was ever done). We went back to them eventually and said that the roof wasn't the problem we raised, the problem was the mould. Finally we were told that someone was coming to inspect the mould. Again they got about four/five inspectors out to view the mould. At least on one occasion when we asked the inspector directly, we were told unequivocally that it is mould and something needed to be done about it. But according to Fletcher's they were told that it wasn't mould and the property was safe to live in. (Not sure if it was by the same inspector or not). They were going to clean it up anyway (suspicious for mould that isn't there) but they would get a quote, sit on it for ages with its status as \"waiting on owner approval\" and then they would decide to get another quote. After the final inspection from a mould company, we asked what was taking so long with getting the quote approved by the owner and was told they weren't able to get in context with them because they were on a holiday in Europe. Eventually we decided to move out citing the mould as the reason which means we could move out right away. Fletcher's came back and asked for us to stay one more month so that we could keep things amicable. They also continued to deny any wrongdoing. In the finally month we also got a notification on TAPI that they wanted to  renovate the kitchen and so where getting someone out to issue a quote for the renovation. I firmly told them I wasn't taking time out of my work day to assist with this and that they could arrange for this person to come out once we had left. Btw there were other issues with the house such as lights not working, windows not opening, AND the heating ducts weren't connected properly. This was my first rental experience and the fact that I know most people are putting up with worse in this current rental market has made me move back in with my parents.

The bathroom was the worst offender, the bathtub plumbing was completely exposed and leakage had been delegated to a removable ice cream tub, which sat on the tiles , at the end of about a metres worth of crudely put together PVC pipe. These strange \u201cfixes\u201d were found all over the property. This was the first major red flag. While superficial, perhaps the worst element of the rental was what my partner and I like to call \u201c fish in the walls\u201d. Somebody had taken it upon themselves to make a Perspex feature wall for their shower. It attempted to emulate a beach scene, including real sand, seaweed, some netting (which was realistically part of a plastic fruit bag), and three taxidermy specimens\u2014 two partially dehydrated, starfish, and one angelfish. I hope it was an angelfish in the afterlife because its body was encased in one of the circles of hell. Yes, instead of fixing the glaring issues in the bathroom, of which there were several, the homeowner decided to put in a transparent sarcophagus for what may once have been a pet fish. It is now condemned for all eternity, to watch unfortunate renters shower. It was so disturbing that I forgot to take a photo, which I deeply regret. \n\nInside the shower, the soap dish had been ripped clean off the wall, and the hole was patched up by duct tape. I could see mould along with the rim of the tape. I think that rentals are mouldy because landlords are mostly boomers who are mouldy and rotting and will thankfully be dead soon.\n\nMoving onto the bedrooms, the inbuilt cupboards were made from unsealed chipboard, evidenced by several of the shelves being extremely warped by liquid. It was so noticeable that I found myself questioning what kind of liquid would end up in a cupboard and then decided not to answer that question for myself.\nAnother thing that I noticed was that there were a couple of ancient air conditioning units that were not functional and still installed into the walls. There were also several new lighting fixtures, one of which was installed so low in the ceiling fan at touch, the top of my partner's head. He is over 6 foot tall plant. The lighting fixture was a candelabra and it would not take much for it to fall on top of someone's head , given how poorly it had been installed. The flooring was an issue, and some of the rooms there was carpet which smelled musty and moldy. This was one of the primary reasons we turned down the property to rent.\n\nTowards the back of the property, the dense foliage had not been cut back from the balcony, making it an actual fire risk. I am talking about large fronds of the trees touching the roof and the side of the balcony. This would also invite spiders and snakes into the house. We knew it backed onto bushland , which is fine. What we didn't expect is that it was flush against the back of the house. This may have been changed since inspecting the property in this state means that they would have expected the tenant to clean it up.\n\nThe rest of the house was a blur to me that what I do remember, is that the design was extremely strange. The bulk of the space was a large, poorly lit garage kitted out with tools and a workbench. This was apparently not part of the lease, but your car could be parked in the garage. This was a huge red flag for me. I don't want to meet the parasite that is taking most of my paycheck for his own personal gain,  let alone have him rummaging around in the shed with tools that could kill me.\n\nThe design of the house is extremely strange, and the vibes were not it.\n\nDespite the horrors that we witnessed, it is far from the worst rental I have ever lived in. \n",

    "review": "Idk where to start. Started the tenancy with 4 working heaters, ended the tenancy with one Vulcan wall heater in the hallway, none in the living area like laws state. The bathroom was re-grouted over existing dirty grout so every time you used anything in there, you'd end up with grout chips everywhere. The bath was peeling? Like the ceramic coating was lifting, they'd painted over it and rented the house with the bath as a feature despite it being unusable. The lounge room wall leaked so bad that twice the swelling of the foundation of the house caused cracks in the walls, exposing the huge amounts of mold all over the house foundation which eventually grew into the lounge. The back room has mold growing on the roof and walls. The kitchen has a gaping hole between the floor and wall where the fridge goes, they'd patched it with some electrical tape. Weeds started growing in through the heater in the back room after it was disconnected. They didn't arrange the gas inspection until 6 months into the tenancy where we learned we'd been using a heater that was leaking carbon monoxide. There's a three inch gap under the front door and no insulation so the house is a fridge in winter, especially with almost no heating options. The drains were so clogged when we moved in that sewerage was spilling out into the backyard which took days to be fixed. There a rat sized hole chewed through the asbestos in the wardrobe in the back room. All of the fixings are older than my parents and barely worked (except those in the kitchen). Half the windows don't open due to being rusted shut. There's lead paint peeling everywhere. There's mold in both bathrooms. The shed is unusable despite being advertised with the property. And after I moved out they upped the asking price $50pw before undertaking any works on the property. Oh and twice I had debt collectors there looking for the owner for not paying their council rates. ",

I think the landlords unfairly placed them in an awkward position re the locksmith invoice and shit plumbing (that solahart system needs to be replaced but they won't do it because $$$). They allowed me to break lease due to hardship and let me return to the property to clean again rather than refuse to return my full bond (which I got back, thankyou). That said, the previous tenants had moved out because their rent jumped from $300 to $400 per week. When I had to break lease due to poverty, the rent was $430/week for 3 bedroom, no improvements to the property.\n\u2022 If the landlords or property manager ever read this...you should rip up the bricks and lay down matting before tiling that back area. Failing that, garden maintenance should be included in the rent. Also, replace that hot water system.  ",

I have been left with one bathroom out of action for 10 weeks and counting, and I was told both repairs would be completed within a couple of weeks of moving in MAX.\n\nDuring the recent storm, my ceiling began to bow and leak water. I tried getting in touch with my property manager, but at 5:20pm on a Wednesday, she didn't pick up her mobile or respond to my messages until the following morning (When she sent me a text message to call her.. professional, huh). I contacted SES as per the instructions on their website who came and replaced a broken tile and cleared the completely occluded gutters (another regular maintenance issue not completed by the owners).\n\nDue to a blockage, I have wastewater backfilling into the kitchen sinks and laundry. The plumber attended and cleared the blockage and explained he had been here last year for the same thing, but the agency didn't want to proceed with the appropriate repairs, so this blockage will continue to happen.\n\nMy downstairs bathroom (the only functioning one in the house) was leaking water into the wall, the tradesmen advised this was a structural concern and could cave in. I was extremely patient with them to get this rectified whilst dealing with damp and mould. When they finally got around to organising the reseal of the bathroom (after 3 different quotes), I was advised I couldn't use the shower for 4 days. This meant I had no means to bathe for 4 days, which Chalk were not concerned about.\n\nI try to get things organised, I take time off of work to be home for tradesmen to come through, but they continuously advise them to quote the repairs and leave, then their quotes are too expensive, and the next tradesmen are organised. This pattern occurs over and over again. I am now in the process of using consumer protection and breach orders as a last-ditch effort to have the work completed. \n\nThis agency is a prime example of agents and landlords taking advantage of the rental crisis and exploiting us for everything while giving little in return. The house I am renting is barely fit for habitation and they are unwilling to uphold their legal obligation. It's so disheartening that they expect tenants to live in these environments but I guarantee they wouldn't themselves.\n\nDo not rent this house or use this company if you value your health, well-being, and sanity.

They then organised a collection. It filled the carport with the amount of stuff and rubbish left behind. Place was advertised with automatic gate and security system and was discussed during inspection then told us after we moved in they weren't working and weren't going to be fixed. This meant the front gate couldn't be opened from the house and required someone to go down to the gate with a key to open it. Realestate also sent someone to the property to completely decommission the gate and security system meaning the gate could not be closed and needed to be propped open. This was a security risk as the gate should have been able to close to secure the property. They did not send an entry notice when that person was coming to the property, we arrived with the gate closed using cable wires. They tried to take us to Qcat for our bond, however given the state of how we found the property we won. We gave some money as we didn't get the carpets cleaned. The house is old and has not been maintained so everything has a feel of not completely clean. The trees in the property drop a lot of leaves so need to be cleaned often.

No flooding for the next 6 months as it was winter so less rainfall during those months in Qld. Flooded a third time so I emailed the PM, she responded saying that the issue would always occur during heavy rain due to the slope of the property and that she suggest I put towels down. A month later I came home from 2 nights away and discovered that the apartment had flooded again, took photos and sent to the PM. She replied asking for more evidence, suggested I might have left the washing machine on to cause flooding, even though I hadn't been home for days. I responded and said this was a known ongoing issue and when I emailed previously she said nothing could be done about it. She replied and said to get a picture of the water outside next time, that the drain is not blocked and that it is strange that it just happened to me, even though I'm almost certain that was not the case. She then said she was closing the matter until I had further proof that the water was from outside.

However, we actually liked the house because of the view and sadly for all involved would have been happy to continue renting it.  The awful, greedy landlord has only themselves to blame.  Oh yeah, the landlord sacked the agent we originally dealt with at the same time they evicted us without cause (we were on a periodic) because they claimed the old agents \"weren't doing their job\" - i.e. screwing enough money out of the tenant.

When we asked the agency to send a professional to clean the mould for these reasons, they said something along the lines of \"the mould has always been there so it's not a problem we're responsible for.\" A few days later the agency sent out a mass email telling tenants to keep their windows open during winter to stop mould from growing.\n\nThe second big issue with this property is the bathroom plumbing. About once a year the sealing around the toilet base would disintegrate and the toilet would seriously leak. The roots of a neighbour's tree had grown through the pipes, and one plumber (not the plumber the agency would send out, but one we booked separately) told us and the agency that the problem would keep happening unless the roots were cut away. Despite this, the agency would push back when we requested they send a plumber to fix the issue.\n\nMy housemates and I have all moved out and the property has since been given a fresh coat of paint and some other work -- but based on the agency's very lazy history, we're not confident they actually fixed any of the issues, and we'd like to warn future tenants about the rampant mould and annual leak.",

The bathroom upstairs had breached into our apartment below & the whole place had such bad rising damp that the internal walls literally leaked water. They then ripped out the wall in the primary bedroom to \u201crepair\u201d the damp, which took months and meant we had to sleep in the living room, which we were never compensated for. Once they had finished, it was apparent that the repair work completed had been done in almost every room of the house, despite the agency claiming to us and later the NCAT that this problem had never been previously identified.\n\nAs a result of the damp, which was never under 90% humidity, everything went mouldy and after trying our best to manage it we tried extensively to have the agent address it unsuccessfully. In one instance the agent stated that the damp was due to use \u201cshowering and then going to work\u201d and leaving the house closed up. The agency refused to give us the contact details of the landlord and on the lease where the contact details legally should be, they had a phone number that redirected back to the agency.\n\nWhen taking them to the NCAT they asked the independent contractor who came to test the humidity to withhold the report from us (which the contractor admitted after initially promising to give us the report then later refusing). Though we won our claim, the whole ordeal was awful, including the landlord accusing us of having \u201cbrought in the mould from [our] previous home\u201d.\n\nThe place was a total nightmare.

[REDACTED] When we first leased our property they had property management staff and the lady we were initially dealing with was excellent. During covid with everything they laid off staff and the wife started dealing with us directly. It became a bit more challenging but was still fine. When our tenancy finished we of course did the final clean through a cleaning company and also had the foresight to have another company complete an independent exit report (they also did an entry report for us as well). As the property was left in pristine condition we didn't think there would be any problems with getting our bond back. Imagine my surprise when the wife informs me that she is keeping our bond and forwards me a bogus exit report. I challenge her and inform her that I had both an entry and exit report done by a third party and forward her these. I inform her that if she looks at the entry report she will note that all the items she is trying to keep my bond for were clearly identified in  the entry report\u2026. Both our independent report and her agency report. She goes silent. I then inform her that I have engaged legal counsel to deal with this on my behalf and I receive a flood of excuses from her saying that she is not trying to profit from illegally keeping my bond and that it's been a tough year and that [REDACTED] etc\u2026.. some real crazy stuff. She then goes on to admit that she has illegally kept my bond, but only to get me back to do another clean before she shows the place to new renters as it has now been some 2 weeks since we moved. She goes on to tell me in writing that \u201call agents do this\u201d and not to take it personally. I inform her that this is blackmail and illegal and agin advise her to go through my lawyers, who have also at this point contacted fair trading.

The patched and painted over the top because there was \"no leaks\" in the roof. My allergies got bad and we thought it was pollen and dust, but later found out that the house had a historical mould problem and they just bleached and painted over it. We had torrential rain and flooding at the start of 2022 and that caused walls to become water damaged, multiple roof leaks and an explosion of mould so bad that it destroyed 2/3 of everything we owned. I even got electrocuted by the house which tripped the circuit breaker due to the moisture in the walls. The mould was growing on glass and stainless steel, and was every colour you'd imagine. We didn't have contents insurance because we couldn't afford it. Our neighbours helped us pull everything out of the house and load trailers full of mould damaged belongings, and let us couch surf. The landlord and real estate, despite showing evidence, noted that there was no mould, there never was any mould, and we just wanted to break lease in the middle of a housing crisis because it was \"easier\". Since we left, they ripped up the carpets, threw away the blinds, installed aircon, renovated the bathrooms and kitchen partially, replaced ceilings and cut out sections of walls, and just painted over the rest. The entire roof cavity was full of mould and they thought this would work. You could see the mould growing on the roof tiles from the neighbours house and on the eaves. They upped the rent from $560 to $885, and within 6 months we got a photo sent to us by the neighbours that the whole roof was being ripped off and replaced because the mould issue had continued and was making the young family living there sick.

That was concering in itself.\n\nA few months before we left We got forwarded notification form the Body Corporate sayign a plumber was coming to inspect 'All units' to quote on replacing the plumbing for tthe building and we had to be home or leave the key with a neighbour so they could have access. On the day I di notice a plumber at about 8:30 but after a few hours I of having no one coming to the unit and notice that Plumber had left I caled the plumber's number on the notification to find out he looked at 2 units then left. This really annoyed me as I had a work mid year party on that day. The plumbing really needs to be replaced but the build is brick and concrete which would make the task very hard.\n\nFinally it was discover the hot water system leaking into downstiars apartment which was very concerning for the structural integrity of the build.\n\nWe glad we have left\n\n\n\n",

It's a two-bedroom tiny apartment. None of the bedrooms have windows. There is NO STORAGE in the kitchen at all or bench space. NONE. As you are underground, you get no phone service so to take calls the internet needs to be connected so you can do Wi-Fi calling. This place is SO DARK that with the power off, in the middle of a sunny day, you can't see your hand in front of your face in the laundry, bathroom, Hall, or either bedroom. As the only bit of natural like is the 7.5 cm you get above the giant wall I look directly out onto. Property also had a mouse problem which the agent (we're GREAT! My original PM Gabby was wonderful - HOWEVER, they sold the rent roll to Besser & Co who were UTTERLY USELESS & rude.) refused to do anything about. I had spend $250 on 'harm-free' traps. But they were not working. So I had to use the normal traps and having been vegetarian for 35 that was just really distressing. The property had a damp issue & always smelt 'weird'.\nHUGE PROBLEM - the laundry were measured incorrectly, so only 3 brands of crappy Chinese top loader washing machine. So try to buy one from the tenant leaving. No dryer will fit. \n\nBesser & Co are USELESS. Took them 6 months to repair the lock on my door THAT WLULDNT LOCK. So my property was not secure for 6 months. They just ignore you.\n\nI filmed the property when I left. Showed a mate who informed me it wasn't remotely up to code to be rented out as a home. Whoever moves in can break lease at any time or that the landlord to VCAT for compensation for being made to live in an 'uninhabitable property* I was going to use my bond as last rent as I was given NTV so the owner could repaint & red-carpet to rent it out at a higher rate. Was EXACTLY the shove I needed to get the fuck outta there!!! It was so dark with no natural light, I honestly had no clue if it was sunshine or raining. We called it the bunker. Living there messed with my mental health for sure, but also my physical health due to whatever is causing that dampness. I was sick CONSTANTLY there. \nI have a video shot the day I left. Shot a midday on a sunny day with the power off.\n\nGreat location. Building manager is very nosey, but if on side will go out of his way to help you. ",

We had no shower use but continued to use the bath, until water began dripping from the ceiling downstairs. Agent notified and we stopped using it immediately. Water continued to build up (as it was the waste pipe which also takes water from the other bathroom).

The landlord like to do all the repairs herself. One morning, our toilet was blocked. My housemate unblocked it with a plunger, but we started to smell something bad. We went outside and the pipe next to the bathroom had burst and there was shit running down the side of the house, into the backyard and underneath the neighbours fence. I thought, surely this classifies as an urgent repair. I call the real estate urgent repair line, the person I speak to says that does sound urgent, we will send someone straight away. We don't hear anything for hours. Later that day my real estate emails me about something else, I reply and say I spoke to urgent repair line this morning and they were supposed to send someone. She replies saying the landlord wants to take a look. I say ok. When the landlord comes around I am not home. The next morning, the real estate agent sends an email saying the landlord has organised a plumber for Friday. It is Tuesday morning. I say - I thought this classified as urgent and needed to be fixed in 24-48 hours? She says yes but the landlord apparently can't find a plumber. My housemates and I are concerned because there is sewage running under the neighbours fence and we can't open the windows on that side of the house because it smells of shit. I do some research and find that if your landlord doesn't organise an urgent repair you are entitled to organise someone to do it, and they have to reimburse you. On Wednesday I think I am going to get a plumber. The first two plumbers I speak to are available. I let the real estate agent know that I've organised a plumber for that afternoon, and she says the landlord wants to be there. The landlord turns up and the first thing she says is \u201cif this plumber is 1 cent over the quote I have from my plumber for Friday you are paying for it\u201d. I say that's not how it works. The plumber rocks up and takes a look and says this is definitely an urgent repair. He gives his quote which is about $100 over her quote. She turns to me and says u will need to pay that. At that point a random lady who I have never met before storms into the backyard, walks straight past me and without looking at me in the eyes says \u201cget out of my way\u201d. I am extremely confused and I think she must be from the real estate  agent because she is wearing corporate clothes. She walks around the side of the house and SCREAMS at the plumber \u201cyou are not authorised to be here\u201d. And I say \u201cexcuse me I am the tenant and I authorised him to be here and I am entitled to because this is an urgent repair\u201d. And she turns to me and screams \u201cI am your landlord and you are going to get evicted\u201d. And I say \u201cyou are not my landlord your name isn't on my lease and I don't know who you are\u201d. And then she just keeps screaming \u201cyou'll see you are going to get evicted\u201d and she keeps screaming at the plumber to get off the property. I am so shocked I go inside the house and start crying. She continues screaming at the plumber in the backyard and then out the front of the house. Eventually they all leave. The plumber calls me and asks if I'm alright and he says that situation was not ok, and he also asks for my real estate agents number so he can report what happened to them. The pipe isn't fixed until Friday. In addition, we overpaid our last rent cycle because the real estate agent messed up our documents up. They agreed that we overpaid rent and they request the landlord the landlord to pay it back, and the landlord never returns it. The real estate say they can't do anything. When we move out I seek compensation from VCAT for the overpaid rent, the landlord makes a counter claim for the exact same amount that we have claimed - for the purpose of their plumber coming to fix the toilet because they found toilet paper blocking the pipe!!!!!!! So we have had our bond withheld and are still owed overpaid rent and it has been nearly three years. I hated this experience and am still shocked at the daughter. I do not recommend this person as a landlord, and in addition I found the real estate agent extremely unhelpful. ",

    "review": "This house has potential to be a really lovely family home with some cool little quirks. However - repairs are not done or if urgent are usually done by a 'handyman' who claims not to understand or speak English and who does the cheapest fix possible, often causing further issues. For example a glass door pane was broken when we moved in. We had small children and had to barricade the door from them; it wasn't fixed in 4 years. The pool had a tear in the bottom and we ended up doing a temp fix that won't hold for long and will once again cause a lot of water to drain from the pool - expensive to keep refilling, which you need to do because you need to keep the pool in good repair and an empty pool can pop out of the ground and break. The newer, renovated half of the house has come apart from the older part of the house, causing a leak from the roof and subsequent mould in the ceiling. This has been temp fixed a couple of times but still leaks. The mould spread and it became impossible to remove it from the bathroom as well as the ceiling. There was also an unreasonable level of noise from the construction happening on 3 sides of the property. On either side houses were / are being demolished and new ones built, which is part of living in suburbia but good to be aware of. Across the street water corp are doing wastewater upgrades which involves heavy (I'm talking house shaking, brick dust coming down the inside of the walls, windows rattling) construction, 6 days a week from 7am to 7pm and now night works as well due to them being behind schedule. It is incessant with giant drills going into the earth, huge trucks coming and going constantly, and general construction noise as well as a lot of dust and occasional sewerage smells. This was going on from start of July and would apparently 'ramp up' over the Christmas period and continue until March 2024 at the earliest.\nThe property manager at this property changed over about 6 times in the 4 years we were there. They messed up inspection times, didn't seem to know what was going on, miscommunicated constantly and were hard to get hold of. They were really unhelpful and unconcerned about the level of discomfort from the construction.

The previous tenant worked at the pub next door and shared screenshots of their own problems with the property, with the same real estate agent i was speaking to.

In the summer, it was like living in a greenhouse, in winter - a morgue. There was a recurring mould problem that the landlord refused to fix. I had to pay for my own mould removal in the end after being so sick from it that I had to stay at my parents house for a few months. As well as this, the landlord had no respect for my privacy. In one instance she had come onto the property unannounced to confront me. Her and the property manager had regularly bullied me when I had submitted repair requests to the point where I had no intention to ask for things that needed fixing including a very flimsy lock on the door that would absolutely not stopped anyone who wished to break in. The house was in such poor condition, repairs were needed regularly. I am astonished I got my bond back in the end. I wouldn't wish this kind of living condition on my worst enemy. It was truely atrocious and I am so lucky I had the resources to fall back on like being relatively close to my parents home, but for someone who doesn't, it would have been horrific.

Besides the house having multiple issues such as mould, having the balcony rotting away (literally only 1 floorboard left), the oven stopped working roughly 1 month into my tenancy, as the seal had come undone. This also meant that the knobs for the stove melted and were not usable. The landlord then came over himself, wathed a youtube tutorial on his phone, took the door off, and left. We were 5 people living in this house, and had no way to cook. He eventually replaced the stoveknobs, but the oven was never fixed.\nThe real-estate agent was definitely evil. COVIR hit and we all lost our jobs, and he promised a rent reduction in person, but when we asked for it in writing, he never responded. We asked him multiple times. Additionally, when I asked if I could record our conversation, he got very angry and yelled at me and my housemates, which was highly intimidating(we were all girls in our early twenties, he was a 40+ year old man). Additionally, he dragged his feet with the new lease, so we never actually got a lease (we were on a rolling one from the previous tenants), which made it difficult for us to take him to court. I did a bit of digging into the agent's past, and he had his real-estate license REVOKED for 10 years due to embellishment back in the early 2000's, which I think perfectly explains what kind of person he was. At the end, we left after ~4 months, had to move during COVID lockdown (which was super stressful), and they took almost our entire bond for cleaning, even though we had cleaned everything and had only been living there for a few months. Finally, the landlord also decided to re-paint one of the bedrooms during COVID, which meant that an unknown man came in every day and painted the room, leaving us limited in the space we were able to use during lockdown when people were not allowed to leave the house.",

If it has remained the same, I do not recommend applying for this property. I can only hope that since living here they have drastically improved the quality of this property.",

Regarding the agent, they were in my opinion, the most incompetent person I have ever met. There was always an excuse to why they hadn't got back to emails. One time they said we hadn't signed a lease and we had to send it to them and point out that they had also signed it. Also when I went for the bond return, it still had a previous housemate on it despite sending the real estate the updated form and them saying they would make the amendments with the bonds office.

The Units are quite small in this building in studio apartment sizes however are in brand new and very good working condition.  There is no insulation in the building so in Winter and Summer it goes from extreme cold to extremely hot (I joked with my work mates that I probably lost a few kgs in weight over the Summer due to it being like a Sauna in my place).  I mentioned this to the Real Estate and they just did not respond at all to this even though it would probably be an easy fix to install insulation. Some or all of the Units are under the National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) which means you have to qualify with an income means test and reapply for your rental every 12 months.  The Real Estate would also renew the Lease every 12 months in line with the NRAS application procedure effectively 'locking you' into a new lease agreement with no 'Break Lease Agreement' available.  This is okay if you do not expect your financial situation to change and are a low income earner and never plan to leave.  When I departed the property even though I had been there a couple of years and a wonderful tenant always paying rent on time and looking after the property, the Real Estate attempted to challenge the Bond refund even though I gave the required 2 weeks notice (due to the no Break Lease Agreement being available scenario). I was able to prove that the Real Estate had not utilised the 2 week notice period to try to locate a new replacement tenant to get my Bond refunded. I also suspected that one of their Agents had entered the premises while I was in the process of leaving/packing and when I was at work as I found wet finger prints on the kitchen pantry cupboards (like someone had washed their hands after using the toilet and then went snooping in my kitchen cupboards), and half flushed toilet paper in the toilet on arriving home from work one day (this is not the only Real Estate I have had this invasive experience with).  The bathroom drains were also blocked on one occasion and the bathroom floor flooded a little bit which I easily fixed with pouring Draino down there, which indicated to me that the pipes had never been regularly maintained like they should be at least in between tenancies. There is a very good modern and new laundry with paid washing and dryer machines for shared tenant use.  It is a very quiet and peaceful building to live in with good tenants so the Real Estate must do very good comprehensive pre screening checks on applicants for tenancy.  Overall I felt thankful to be in such a brand new shiny Unit for the reduced NRAS price, however it became high maintenance for me to clean the really expensive glass doors in the bathroom every week.

And then it took weeks to unpack everything off the floor before I could vacuum, and he then I didn't even have one anymore. When I got the initial electrical inspection just after I moved in the electricians said something about the switchboard was either illegal, or at least less than ideal (two things on the one switch from memory). The mailbox was full of mouldy mail from previous tenants. The grout in the shower was already terrible when I first moved in. Now it's still bad, but trying to clean it made the silicone start coming off, so I stopped because I didn't wanna cause worse damage. The knobs on the stovetop and oven are misaligned, so it's hard to tell what you're even doing. The windows are locked and none of my keys open them (and they keep saying we have to allow adequate ventilation\u2026 how???). The overhead fan in the bathroom is basically redundant because the bathroom ALWAYS has condensation running down the place. The connection to what I think is the TV aerial is in the dumbest place known to man, so I didn't even bother connecting it. The hot water doesn't work properly in winter. There's no adequate heating or cooling (only heating is wedged between the wall and bed which can't feasibly be moved anyway, so it's a major safety hazard). Property manager never actually fixes anything unless it's so bad they'd get in serious trouble. They tried to spring an inspection on me with two days notice. The reason was \u201cvaluation\u201d. When I questioned it, they sent me a link to QUEENSLAND tenant legislation. I looked up Victoria's, screenshotted it, and sent it back saying because they didn't give a week they couldn't come in to mine (yes, even though they were going to all the rooms that day. If the others let them in, that's their problem and I'm not sorry for the inconvenience. Do it properly or get out). The description of the place also said something about under-bed storage. No such storage exists. Property managers said we had to change our own lights, but at least my room has downlights, which I remember being told should be changed by a professional. They refused to do anything. The overhead range hood for the stove is supposed to have a light, but it doesn't work, creating a show when you're trying to cook. Absolutely zero storage in the bathroom but space for a cupboard (had to get my own because of course people keep things in their bathroom). Toilet seat never stays attached to the actual toilet. Stuff keeps falling apart and they have the audacity to increase the rent. It may be cheaper than getting into a normal rental on my own, but it's not worth what they're charging. I'm 1 out of about 10-14 units I think (I can't remember, j never took much notice). I'm still here, but they're gonna knock it down by the sounds of it some time next year. Only solid perk is it's across the road from my uni.",

We had broken and not functioning blinds in the master, to which the provider decided was too costly to fix and would keep delaying the repair order by rejecting quotes for blinds for being too expensive. In the end we lived there for 3 months, fought with the real estate everyday to provide basic necessities, escalated to the managers at Ray White, served them multiple breaches of the tenancy act, threatened the hot water issue to go to VCAT and instead we were offered to leave early without any break lease fees.

    "review": "Negatives:\n- The house looks excellent in photos and even on inspection person; however, it was built specifically to flip (confirmed by neighbours). Once moved in, you begin to notice the little things. Like how although there are dozens of cupboards, they are all extremely shallow, severely limiting how much you can put in them. They're about 3 cans of baked beans deep. The closets are so shallow that you can't fit a standard clothes hanger in without turning it diagonal, and there's no closet shelving. The laundry shelves can fit 1 rolled up towel deep. 4 if stacked.\n- The driveway is extremely narrow and steep and the car port is at the bottom, so it's basically un-usable as the side of the house is about 30cm from your car door.\n- The walls have no insulation and are very \"thin\". I can hear the TV in the loungeroom at the back of the house from the office at the front of the house even when it's on a relatively normal volume.\n- The water is very hard and has discoloured all of the bathroom tiling.\n- Almost everything is gas, so expect your gas bills to sky rocket. During winter with 2 adults and 1 kid while setting the heating to only turn on for an hour or two at morning and evening, my quarter gas bill was over $1100.\n- The house acts like a faraday cage so make sure you have internet because you won't be getting reception inside.\n- No power point anywhere in the hallway or foyer so you've got no ability to have any lamps in that section of the house.\n- Carpet in the bedrooms is low quality. Looks nice, but wears out real quick. \n- Back veranda timber is not treated.\n- Laundry is tiny. I had to take one of the doors off to fit the front load washer/dryer combo. \n- Front door doesn't have a door handle, only a deadbolt which is extremely annoying. \n\nPositives:\n- The current owner and real estate (based in Leura) are excellent. They have immediately fixed multiple things that were not cheap, and often have someone out for a quote within 2 days of a request. \n- The back garden is beautiful and has a small stream with a bridge and a large fish pond (though the lining is cracked and so the pond is leaking underground).\n- Double glazed windows.\n- Nice main bathroom. Decent master ensuite.\n- Quality Smeg oven/gas cooktop and dish washer.\n- Big butlers pantry. Nice large open-plan kitchen, dining, and lounge area.\n- Heating works real well - but is costly.\n- Massive under-house storage.\n- Neighbours are nice.",

The damage was fixed when we vacated, but not the actual cause or issue.  One night we woke up to a thud and the ceiling over the stairs had collapsed in at 3am in the morning.  After we had spent 3 months reporting the issue to the agent.  \nThere's another big leak from the door behind the TV.  Which meant having to love with our TV in the middle of the lounge room for a month or so.  The kitchen cabinetry is also all peeling off.  It's a decent place on the surface.  But if you like to sleep and have a dry place, stay away!  Agent is 'nice' but also useless.  We lasted 9months out of a 12 month lease at a hugely reduced covid rent of $750 a week.

Property was clean upon move-in and any maintanence requests were dealt with promptly. The only issue we had was a pretty dodgy attempt to claim part of our bond due to a 'greasy rangehood' claim from the landlord at the final inspection. We hired professional lease cleaners at the end of our tenancy which included rangehood cleaning as part of the service. As soon as we asked for photos of the greasy rangehood to send to our cleaners, the REA suddenly found our condition report and saw that the rangehood was left in the same condition as at the beginning of the tenancy. Apart from that, they were always great to deal with but always be careful. ",

The RE never did an inspection in the whole year that I lived there and never responded to any issues that I had.

I lived there earlier, and what this review had missing is that the landlord, for many years, operated an illegal squalid boarding house behind the property, with individual  outdoor rooms, as well as a kitchen and bathroom, with no common indoor areas (i.e to get from one room to another you had to go outside). This boarding house housed some pretty vulnerable people evidently (People with drug addictions, or in poverty), and while there is nothing wrong with low a cost accommodation for these people, I'd say it's a necessity - the living conditions were absolutely squalid. The rooms had broken windows, doors, damaged plumbing, and garbage everywhere. I'm not exaggerating when I say I've seen slums overseas that were in a better state.\nIt was so uninhabitable that eventually local authorities got involved, the property was deemed unlivable, as it was deemed a fire and health risk. Fixing up these rooms was determined to be IMPOSSIBLE - it was that bad. The tenants living in this boarding house were told they had to leave, some of them forced in to homelessness. \nWhen this happened, the residents in the front property (the terrace house) were given a huge rental increase (like it's their fault the landlord operated a slum). Meanwhile, the boarding house at the rear of the property, then vacant was left as is - garbage, syringes,  and furniture strewn throughout the backyard for about 6 months. Landlord does not care about leasing out property that is livable by any standard - he simply does not care. He was running illegal accommodation for years and only stopped because he got caught.

    "review": "Unit itself wasn't bad when we first moved in. While it was managed by an agency, the landlord insited on doing all repairs himself. The carpet and whole place was filthy, I spent two days cleaning before we moved in. I hired a carpet shampoo machine from bunnings and cleaned the carpets myself. Huge cracks in the tiles in the shower made it impossible to clean, the more you tried to clean it the more chunks of mould would spill out. The carpet was also really worn thin, in some areas the securing wood and nails were exposed and a hazard, took the landlord a few weeks to remedy this. The toilet broke and was unable to half flush, the landlord again took a number of weeks to fix it. He refused to use a proper tradesman and did it himself. The toilet bowl was not secured to the flooring after his repairs and would rock when you sat on it. The gas ducted heating broke and it took him upwards of 10 weeks before deciding whether to repair or replace. During this time he asked if we would be open to a $20 per week rent increase. He ended up replacing the ducted central heating with a single split system in the living room. Meaning the windowless bathroom started growing mould. The property manager was great and she was really on our side, it was the landlord that made life difficult. ",

We didn't have a functioning phone line unless the phone companies cut off the business below us, and it took about a year to have internet wired to my residence. The downstairs portion of the house was unliveable and had no privacy, and was stumped so long ago that running was downright hazardous and walking would give guests vertigo. The oven never worked. Nor did the bathtub. The landlord had screwed all the windows shut and complained when I unscrewed them. There was extensive water damage to the house and parts of the ceiling had given way (the fix was done with varieties of sticky tape). The landlord kept his vintage car in the garage and when local businesses would park in front of it he would knock on our door at any hour to ask me to have the cars moved. I caught him multiple times standing outside looking into the  property windows. He'd done all the electricity himself and according to a private tradie, he'd crossed it with the plumbing, which proved to be a hazard when the water heater blew up and I was electrocuted turning on a light switch. The real estate were negligent entered the house multiple times without permission or when they thought my roommates and I weren't home. There was a big drama with the water bill as Melbourne Water had never been notified that the property was being rented out, and it was registered in the landlord's wife's name under a private business. We were paying the water bill (hefty due to constantly leaking taps and meter), but the invoices weren't ever addressed to us until we eventually threatened VCAT. There's a single split system unit in the uninhabitable downstairs living room, and the place would get so unbearably hot in the summer that we would have to stay with friends. ",

When we were told we were the successful applicants, we were also told that the real estate had 'accidentally' not advertised the actual rental price stipulated by the landlord, so it was increased by about $20. We opted to still take the property rather than keep looking. When picking up the keys, we were given a long list of repairs due to be completed which were promised to be completed and noted on the lease as forming part of the condition of the property. The most impactful of these ended up being holes in fly screens and broken power points (which had allegedly been punched by the previous tenant, and you kind of had to stick your finger inside the socket to turn them on\u2026.eek!). The fly screens were never repaired, instead the agency instructed us to put sticky tape over the many holes. We did, but never worked as well as actually functioning fly screens = constant supply of flies and other assorted bugs (repaired fly screens were part of the rental agreement). We had to send some cranky emails to finally get the power points repaired, pointing out the risk of death by electrocution as being a relatively likely scenario before they did anything.\n\nWhen we first got the keys and opened the house, the lounge room absolutely reeked of cat urine. The agent assured us it had been professionally cleaned as the previous owners had allegedly had cats in the house. The agency thankfully sent carpet cleaners again, who used a blue light to show where the urine damage was, and it took up about 1/4 of the carpet. The carpet was very worn and it was suggested the it should be replaced, as cleaning it wouldn't help. Well, carpet was cleaned again, and continued to smell. Especially on a nice of summers day, which was exacerbated by having no insulation in the ceiling of our western facing wall. \n\nWalls had lots of patching from holes being punched in them, and a quick paint job to cover up. There was one room that had quite old yellow sticky stuff on it that we forgot to put in our entry condition report (our error). \n\nWhen we left, we were advised we weren't getting some of our bond back due to the sticky stuff on the wall, and some damage to skirting. Luckily, we had photos of the damaged skirting. We requested quotes for the approximately $500 bill for patching the paint. We disputed it, and lodged a tribunal application. After we lodged it, the real estate told us they were dropping the claim for the repairs due to \u201chow unreasonable you are being.\u201d Our tribunal appeal was also seeking compensation for loss of enjoyment due to things that weren't repaired (the list was longer than mentioned above) and having to deal with cat piss scented carpet every time it got really hot outside (and even hotter inside the uni uninsulated house). I'll always giggle at the 'unreasonable' comment, but it was a really unnecessarily stressful time, having a real estate fight us so hard for an owner that was happy for his tenants to live under these conditions.",

    "review": "I rented 15/6 Francis Grove Thornbury VIC from February 2021 to February 2022. The flat was covered in dust when I moved in, mould all over the bathroom ceiling and tiles, mould growing on the bedroom window shades. I had to take the landlord to court to get the mould removed, four out of the five windows were broken when I moved in (and after a year only two of the windows were fixed), the floors were old carpet or lino, some of the lights were bare lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling, the bedroom wall had a hole in it where you could see through to the outside and when I raised it with the maintenance guy he said and I quote, \"You want the airflow though, these places get a lot of damp\". The lock on my flat's letterbox had been broken open before I moved in, and was never repaired despite my requests, so my mail was open to being stolen by the known mail thief we had in the area. The rent for this shabby ground-floor 1-bedroom flat was $1195/month, which at the time was about 68% of my Disability Support Pension. The flat is surrounded closely by other flats and has an upstairs flat, so you get surround-sound ambience of your neighbours's plumbing, sex noises, vomiting, arguing, TV, talking on the phone, everything. While I lived there, most of the neighbours had a group text about the neighbours from hell who terrorised the rest of us. The hell neighbours would sexually harass me when I left my flat, hang out in the garden right outside my windows and leave their empty beer tins on my window sill, look in my windows, steal my deliveries (they stole everyone's deliveries), throw pot plants and knives off their balcony in fits of rage, and unplug my hot water system. The final straw for me was when I found one of the neighbours committing arson outside my bedroom window one night. I found out from the group text it wasn't the first time he'd done arson at the apartment complex. I moved out after that (my mental health was in pieces). The body corporate knew because several tenants were keeping them informed, Haughton Stotts knew because I informed them, the Northcote police station knew, everyone knew about all the problems happening at 6 Francis Grove, but no one with any power to help did anything about it. Most of the people living there were living quiet modest lives, a lot of us on low incomes, and our quality of life meant nothing to the people in power. Quiet enjoyment was not a thing. I only gave this rental a 2 instead of a 1 because it had air-conditioning in the living room and a bathtub (although ancient and rusty) and was ground floor so I could access the flat with my disability, which is a fucking unicorn of a combo in inner north Melbourne rentals. There was a nice community there and it was connected to a heritage-listed old mansion set back off a quiet street away from traffic noise, and could have been a lovely sanctuary of for people on low incomes in the inner north, but landlords just wanted to collect ridiculous amounts of rent on shitty old flats they bought for a song in the 1970s and knew they could just replace me with another unsuspecting tenant after the horrendous living situation had burned me out. No one warned me before moving in there of all the antisocial problems happening at that property, which were well-known and probably still happening. The flat I lived in, number 15, was apparently one of the worst locations for it because I was kind of in the centre of everything and the yelling/arson/violence/drinking etc would happen literally a foot from any of my windows. It often felt unsafe to go out my front door, and the group text confirmed that being a young woman meant I was copping it worse than other tenants had. So I'd like to warn anyone thinking about renting 15/6 Francis Grove Thornbury, especially if like me they were driven there by the lack of disability-accessible or affordable rentals in inner north Melb. They should at least know what they're getting into.",

The landlord later started coming over almost everyday and would either do some gardening or just sit in the back yard.

I spoke with the property manager who told me she actually found him quite creepy and said she would speak to him on the matter. She did email him saying that he cannot show up unannounced and without a reason and that he needs to respect my privacy as no where on my rental agreement was it mentioned that he would be at the property.

After ignoring our calls and texts for ages the real estate agency finally answered and tried to gaslight us to believe that it was like that when we moved in. They finally sent someone to put a temporary patch on the roof and put wooden planks across our bedroom ceiling to try to hold it up. They finally sent someone again to look at the roof again, and the guy looks at our tile roof and goes \"um I do tin roofs\" and leaves. They never send someone to look at it again. They then just ignore our messages and calls about it until finally admitting in person that they can't get the landlord to fix it and hes just going to wait until we move out to do renos (which would be almost 2.5 years of it not being repaired) so there's nothing they can do. With the assistance of the tenancy union we gave a notice to terminate which the owner and real estate has said they don't accept. Instead they are trying to get us to spend hundreds of dollars to put the rental back on the market without repairs.

The mould was so bad in the ceiling you could see it on the outside of the house after six months. I was able to clean inside the house, but what was going on in the ceiling was horrific. The real estate replied with \"but it has a new roof\". I followed up to question how long it gone needing a new roof and if the insulation had been changed. They couldn't answer this but were adamant on trying to make it my fault. When we applied we offered more if they could put a dishwasher in. The owner had installed it himself. The pipes behind it had melted to the back of the machine and water was going everywhere. It was never fixed yet I continued to pay rent that included the extra for a dishwasher. The gas oven was rusted out. The owner actually turned up for this and installed a second hand one himself- that didn't work and was never fixed again. During our time in this house we never missed rent and had the house spotless when they came for the inspections, Until my husband died. literally within weeks of me informing them he had passed away I had an inspection and this time, I didn't get rid of the mould growing in the shape of the roof batons in the ceiling. I didn't scrub and when a new agent (never had the same agent) came for the inspection I told her how over it I was. She told the owner that the work had to be done!!! his reply was to evict me. I decide to move states. I had gone through hell. My husband had been killed by a drunk driver, I had found out my youngest was special needs and evicted. So I paid cleaners $900 to do an end of lease clean and a guy $200 to make sure the yards were good and left. The photos provided to me showed it was clean and tidy. Just like the two single women who had rented before me (neighbour informed) they took my full bond. I was grieving, in Queensland with no strength to fight it so I just let it go as I was buying a house so the loss of it wasn't detrimental to my rental history or ability to have a roof over my head. I have since seen many people saying the real estate had tried to take their full bonds. That it was what they do. If you fought it you got it back, if you didn't like me you lost the whole thing.

Owner tells all of your information to ex wife even though units have absolutely nothing to do with her, he pays for her to get full renovations on her unit including aircon etc while we live with not even a ceiling fan, holes in walls, carpet so old it's mouldy and matted etc and when you request maintenance he tells his ex wife who then accuses you of purposely damaging property. Even with security cameras this stops nothing. 1000% don't recommend!",

We also found out our neighbour had a restraining order against the landlord. The Landlord once came to review the rotting floor boards (as kitchen flooded every single time we used the shower) and during this visit he'd parked in our neighbours driveway.. he argued with her about how it doesn't matter if she leases the property from him, at the end of the day it's his house and he'll park in the driveway if he wanted\u2026.

In the 3yrs I've been here, I've never seen this lady since she never leaves her house so I have no idea what she looks like, how old she is or even her name. She made it known that she had an issue with the level of noise coming from my apartment by spending all night on the phone (or talking to herself?) about everything I do in my apartment and how it annoys her, everything from my singing in the shower, to my TV playing, even going as far as recording me in my own apartment and playing it back through the night. She was knocking on my walls, throwing things at my garden shed, pacing back and forth near my bedroom, laughing manically at 7am and screaming like a psycho late at night! I've endured weeks of sleepless nights, even having to go to the hospital because it triggered my PTSD. Her harassment didn't settle down until I involved police to go speak to her to make her stop. Even now I don't feel comfortable in my own home and don't invite anyone over anymore. I can't take phone appointments in my own house without fear of her listening in on my conversation and hearing my personal information. I'm saving up enough money and moving out of this shithole and not looking back!
